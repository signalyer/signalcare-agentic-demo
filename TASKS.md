## Phase 0 — Scaffold (session 2026-07-07)

- [x] Create repo directory structure (57 directories)
- [x] Write `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `TASKS.md`
- [x] Write `docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example`, `Makefile`, `pyproject.toml`, `.gitignore`
- [x] Write FastAPI `main.py` skeleton + `Dockerfile`
- [x] Write initial ADRs (0001 Python/FastAPI, 0002 Adapter pattern) + template
- [x] Write `docs/build-plan.md` + `docs/demo-script.md`
- [x] Write `infra/postgres/init.sql` + `infra/ollama/models.txt`
- [x] Write L3 agents README + L6 adapters README (conventions)
- [x] Author handoff file `docs/handoffs/2026-07-07-scaffold-to-week1.md`
- [x] `git init` and initial commit (root-commit `7c61907`, 2026-07-07)
- [x] ~~Confirm docker-compose stack comes up cleanly~~ → **deferred to Phase 3 via ADR-0003** (no container runtime on Week 1 host machine; native Ollama covers Week 1 needs)

---

## Phase 1 — Week 1: AI Gateway Adapter + Hello World Agent

**Note (ADR-0003):** Docker-compose stack bring-up moved to Phase 3. Week 1 uses **native Ollama on Windows** (`http://localhost:11434`) + OpenRouter (hosted). Everything else in the compose stack is not on the Week 1 code path.

- [x] Install native Ollama on Windows + pull `llama3.2:3b` (winget silent install, model live at localhost:11434)
- [x] Implement `app/L6_adapters/ai_gateway/base.py` interface (`complete`, `stream`) — commit 7c61907
- [x] Implement `app/L6_adapters/ai_gateway/local.py` — Ollama concrete — commit 7c61907
- [x] ~~Implement `openrouter.py`~~ → **superseded by `anthropic_gateway.py` per ADR-0004** (direct SDK; OpenRouter 402 no-credits triggered pivot)
- [x] Implement `app/L6_adapters/ai_gateway/anthropic_gateway.py` — Anthropic direct SDK concrete (Balanced=Sonnet, Reasoning=Opus). Handles `system` split + `temperature` deprecation sentinel — ADR-0004
- [x] Wire tier-based routing in `app/L6_adapters/ai_gateway/router.py` (Fast → Ollama, Balanced/Reasoning → Anthropic) — commit 7c61907, updated per ADR-0004
- [x] Add `/agents/echo` endpoint in FastAPI `main.py` (accepts `tier` + `prompt`, returns text + model + provider + latency + token counts) — commit 7c61907
- [x] **Hello-world agent call live-verified on all three tiers** (Fast: llama3.2:3b 601ms warm; Balanced: claude-sonnet-4-6 1091ms; Reasoning: claude-opus-4-7 1603ms) — this closes the ADR-0002 proof-point empirically
- [x] Unit tests `tests/unit/test_ai_gateway.py` — 13/13 passing offline (added Anthropic adapter internals)
- [x] Integration tests `tests/integration/test_ai_gateway_live.py` — 3/3 passing live (Ollama + Anthropic + same-interface proof-point)
- [x] Add `make status-lite` target (native Ollama ping + OpenRouter reachability check) — commit 7c61907
- [~] ~~Grafana dashboard #1: request rate, latency, model breakdown~~ → **moved to Phase 3** (batched with the other three dashboards; interim visibility via `structlog` stdout)

### Phase 1 CLOSED: 2026-07-07. All Week 1 code deliverables live-verified. Ready for Phase 2.

### Open design point surfaced this session (blocks Phase 2 wiring)
- [ ] Env loading path: uvicorn `--env-file` (A, currently in effect) vs centralised `pydantic-settings` `Settings` loaded once at startup (B, better fit for Phase 3 when Postgres/NATS/Vault creds land). Live verify uses A via `uvicorn main:app --env-file ..\.env`. Document in README or migrate to B before Phase 3 credentials wiring.

## Phase 2 — Week 2: L1 API + L2 Guardrails + Agent #8 Compliance/Ops (Founder Mode)

- [x] Implement `app/L2_guardrails/baa_gate.py` — real middleware that blocks PHI-bearing calls to unapproved endpoints — commit d02b92a (ADR-0005 wrap-the-router), retrofitted to phi_present-conditional in commit 7d104ba (ADR-0006)
- [x] Implement `app/L2_guardrails/phi_redactor.py` — T1-T4 tiered redaction — commit 7d104ba (regex-based; Presidio swap-in noted; 22 new unit tests; runtime stack now `PHIRedactor(BAAGateGuard(TieredAIGateway))`; 50/50 unit tests green)
- [x] Implement `app/L2_guardrails/injection_sentinel.py` — prompt injection classifier — commit 7289983 (ADR-0007 hybrid regex+LLM; regex-first with 10 anchored patterns, suspicion-keyword-gated Fast-tier LLM fallback via injected classifier; classifier reuses gate-wrapped router — no recursion, no redactor bypass of raw content; defensive `phi_present=True` on classifier calls; fail-open on classifier error; `SENTINEL_MODE=block|flag|off` env; `InjectionSentinelError` → HTTP 400; runtime stack now `InjectionSentinel(PHIRedactor(BAAGateGuard(TieredAIGateway)), classifier=BAAGateGuard(TieredAIGateway))`; 46 new unit tests; 96/96 unit tests green)
- [ ] Implement `app/L3_agents/compliance_ops/` — Founder Mode digest agent (UX spec'd in ADR-0008: fixed 5-section structure, 300-word cap, evidence-only synthesis, JSON schema in prompt, admin UI + file persistence, apscheduler 06:30 local, email deferred to Phase 3; ready to implement)
- [ ] Data sources for digest: docker stats, Postgres audit table, fake `hardening_status.json`
- [ ] Prompt: registered in YAML at `app/L0_observability/prompts/compliance_ops_digest.yaml` (schema spec'd in ADR-0009 §3)
- [ ] Prompt registry — Phase 2 `FileBackedPromptRegistry` per ADR-0009 (YAML-first + JSON state snapshot + content-hash versioning + drift log). Postgres runtime table deferred to Phase 3 as time-boxed rule-6 relaxation.
- [ ] Cron job: daily digest at 06:30
- [ ] Simple digest page in Admin UI
- [ ] Test: full flow from cron trigger → LLM → digest email/UI

## Phase 3 — Week 3: Remaining 7 L6 Adapters + L4 Orchestrator + Telemetry

- [ ] `L6_adapters/identity/` — Keycloak OIDC adapter
- [ ] `L6_adapters/compute/` — docker-compose adapter (health/restart interface)

- [ ] Fingerprint / dedup by content hash
- [ ] Taxonomy classifier (LLM-based)
- [ ] OCR pipeline: tesseract + docling for layout
- [ ] Confidence scoring per field
- [ ] `app/L2C_rag/` — pgvector index, permission filter BEFORE search, hybrid retrieval, reranker
- [ ] `app/L3_agents/document_extraction/` — full agent with citation resolution
- [ ] Verification Workbench UI page
- [ ] End-to-end: upload PDF → OCR → evidence object created → citations resolvable

## Phase 5 — Week 5: Agent #1 Provider Intake + Session Store + Feature Readiness UI

- [ ] `app/L3_agents/provider_intake/` — conversational tool-calling agent
- [ ] Session persistence in Postgres via relational adapter
- [ ] Chat UI page in Admin UI
- [ ] Tool: `update_field`, `validate_form`, `save_draft`, `submit_referral`
- [ ] Human confirmation UI: shows collected data + confirm/edit before submit
- [ ] Admin UI: Feature Readiness Registry (CRUD)
- [ ] Seed: `capability_key`, `status`, `evidence`, `owner`, `last_verified` for 10 sample capabilities
- [ ] Test: full intake flow from chat start to referral persisted

## Phase 6 — Week 6: Agent #4 Reconciliation + L2A Memory + Agent Capability Matrix UI

- [ ] `app/L2A_memory/working/` — Redis-backed session memory
- [ ] `app/L2A_memory/episodic/` — Postgres durable interaction log with PHI-scoped policy
- [ ] `app/L2A_memory/semantic/` — pgvector store for stable facts
- [ ] `app/L3_agents/reconciliation/` — cross-source conflict detection agent
- [ ] Conflict Panel UI with citation links
- [ ] Test: seed 2 conflicting extracted docs, verify agent surfaces conflict with citations
- [ ] Admin UI: Agent Capability Matrix (read-only view of all 5 agents with their tools, PHI status, HITL gates)

## Phase 7 — Week 7: Agent #6 Clinical Summary + Adversarial Verify + Evidence/RAG Health UI

- [ ] `app/L3_agents/clinical_summary/` — Reasoning-tier agent
- [ ] `app/L2_guardrails/adversarial_verify.py` — two-agent verify pattern
- [ ] Clinical sign-off gate at API boundary
- [ ] Provenance viewer: click citation → open source PDF with snippet highlighted
- [ ] Admin UI: Evidence/RAG Health dashboard (index freshness, OCR failure rate, citation coverage, docs needing verification)
- [ ] End-to-end happy path: referral → docs → extraction → reconciliation → clinical summary → RN sign-off
- [ ] Test: adversarial verify catches a low-confidence output and returns it to primary

## Phase 8 — Week 8: Eval Harness + Prompt Registry Browser + Demo Script + Polish

- [ ] `evals/golden_set.json` — 20 examples across all 4 flagship agents
- [ ] `evals/run_evals.py` — pytest-style runner with report generation

## Backlog (post-Phase 8, not scoped)

- Multi-tenant scoping (2+ seeded tenants)
- Remaining 3 agents implemented (Completeness, Eligibility, Packet Assembly)
- Workflow safety controls (lint, regression, impact analysis, rollback)
- Rule Test Console
- Deployment Safety UI module
- Import/export for admin config
- Kubernetes deployment (optional — proves the cloud-agnostic property under load)

## Blockers / Open Questions

1. Which OpenRouter model IDs to use for Reasoning/Balanced tiers — pick during Week 1 setup.
2. Ollama model selection depending on user's local GPU capability — pick during Week 1 setup.
3. Whether to use Keycloak or skip it in favor of JWT+test-IdP (Week 1 decision).
